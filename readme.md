# Overview
This app was created as part of the JS tutorial series in [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). The goal of the exercise is to implement a simple sketchboard application similar to an etch-a-sketch using DOM manipulation and the event loop. 

It was a lot of fun to build this although there were some minor headaches getting the functionality to work properly. I am happy with how it turned out and hope you will have fun checking it out!

# Getting Started

To use the Sketchboard App, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the app in your web browser.
2. Select a color, if desired.
3. Start drawing on the canvas.
